    "workflow_description": "Create a data backup system that: 1) Lists all .txt files in the current directory, 2) Creates a 'backup' directory if it doesn't exist, 3) For each .txt file, check if it's been modified in the last 24 hours (if we can't determine this, assume it has been), 4) If modified recently, copy it to the backup directory with a timestamp in the filename, 5) After all files are processed, create a manifest.json file in the backup directory listing all backed up files and their original modification times, 6) Finally, make three HTTP requests in parallel to example.com, httpbin.org/get, and jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1. After all requests complete, write the combined results to a file named 'api_results.json'."
