    "workflow_description": "The Deep Research agent operates through a systematic, multi-stage process:\n 1. Research Planning: The ResearchPlanGenerator creates a comprehensive research strategy tailored to the user's topic, which is then fed directly into the Planner as its operational roadmap.\n 2. Orchestration Loop: The Planner receives and follows the research plan while continuously evaluating progress and determining the next optimal action. The actions it can perform are listed below. This creates an adaptive cycle that responds to emerging research needs while staying aligned with the original strategy.\n 3. Information Gathering: When the Planner determines additional data is needed, it activates the Searcher, which retrieves relevant webpages and documents from diverse sourcesâ€”including internal websites, knowledge bases, and external web resources. All findings are stored in a centralized cache that becomes accessible to other components.\n 4. Section Creation: Once the Planner determines sufficient information is available, it engages the Writer, which pulls from the cached documents to develop new article sections. The generated content is then appended to the growing article structure.\n 5. Section Refinement: Throughout the process, the Planner may deploy the Editor to access and enhance existing article sections, ensuring content quality while preserving accurate citations and source attribution."
